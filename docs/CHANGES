  2014-02-25 Converge 2.1

This is a minor bugfix release that fixes portability issues. It also
synchronises the VM with RPython 2.2.1, allowing Converge to build on recent
RPython releases. This therefore brings advantages such as incremental
garbage collection.


  2012-07-31 Converge 2.0

This release contains a new VM written in RPython. Depending on your program
and the length of time it runs, this will lead to a 2x-100x speedup. Programs
should run as before, but will need to be recompiled (the easiest way of
doing this is, on the first run of a program on Converge 2.0 to use the "-f"
switch which forces a recompile).


  2011-05-29 Converge 1.2

This release contains many portability fixes and optimisations. Converge should
now run with full optimisations on all major platforms.

There are also several compile-time meta-programming fixes, documentation
enhancments, and additional functions (e.g. File::temp_file). 


  2009-09-08 Converge 1.1

This release contains many minor fixes and enhancements. Major changes include:

  * Src infos are now triples (src file, src offset, len) meaning that error
    reporting is now much more detailed.

  * Parse trees have now changed representation from lists to instances of
    specific classes. Parse tree walking code needs to be updated accordingly.

  * Simple dynamic linking of core libraries.

  * Much enhanced backtraces (when curses is available).



  2008-02-25 Converge 1.0

Initial public release of the 1.0 series.
