To build Converge you need at a minimum PyPy's source. It is recommended you
use the latest version of PyPy available on <http://pypy.org/download.html>.
You do not need to install PyPy, but Converge needs access to its source in
order to build itself. The PYPY_SRC variable should point at the root of the
PyPy source distribution.

If you are building from a formal Converge release, the latest stable release
of PyPy is likely to be sufficient. e.g. if PyPy 1.9 is the latest version:

  $ cd <somewhere>
  $ wget https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/get/release-1.9.tar.bz2
  $ bunzip2 -c - release-1.9.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
  $ export PYPY_SRC=<somewhere>/pypy

If you are building from a git checkout of Converge, it is recommended to
check PyPy out from its Mercurial repository:

  $ cd <somewhere>
  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
  $ export PYPY_SRC=<somewhere>/pypy

Once you have obtained PyPy and set the PYPY_SRC variable appropriately then,
subject to platform specific notes in README.<platform>, one can normally
build Converge by executing the following commands:

  $ ./configure
  $ make

If you wish to run Converge's regression suite:

  $ make regress

================================================================================

  Building from a git checkout
 
Converge only keeps a bootstrap compiler for 64-bit machines in version control.
If you are running another type of machine, you will need to download a recent
snapshot and extract the appropriate bootstrap compiler and linker. e.g.:

  cp <snapshot>/bootstrap/<your machine type>/convergec.bootstrap bootstrap/<your machine type>
  cp <snapshot>/bootstrap/<your machine type>/convergel.bootstrap bootstrap/<your machine type>

You then follow the normal build instructions as above. After doing so, it is
then recommended that you rebuild once more to check that the newly compiled
compiler functions correctly:

  make clean
  make

After this you're done - please feel free to contribute patches!
